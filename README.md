In this project, we will be exploring the Yelp dataset, which contains a vast collection of reviews for different businesses, including restaurants. Our objective is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately predict the sentiment of restaurant reviews, thereby enabling restaurant owners to identify areas for improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.

Part I: Sentiment Analysis of the Restaurant Reviews from YELP Dataset

In Part I, we will start by performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Yelp dataset. We will analyze the distribution of the reviews, their lengths, and other important features that will help us gain insights into the dataset's structure and content. We will also perform some data preprocessing steps, including cleaning and tokenization, to prepare the data for model training. \

Furthermore, we will evaluate the performance of our BERT model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and also perform some data visualization to gain insights into the sentiment distribution of the Yelp reviews. \

Part II: Converting Yelp Reviews into Sentiment Scores with BERT

We will be using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to convert Yelp reviews into sentiment scores. BERT is a powerful pre-trained language model that can accurately capture the contextual meaning of text. We will fine-tune BERT on the Yelp dataset, and use it to predict the sentiment of restaurant reviews.

Part III: Restaurant Recommendation

We will use the sentiment scores generated in Part II to develop a restaurant recommendation system. We will use collaborative filtering techniques to recommend restaurants to users based on their past ratings and reviews. Additionally, we will incorporate the geographical location of the restaurants to recommend restaurants based on the user's location and recommend the highest-rated restaurants in their vicinity. \

To accomplish this, we will use techniques such as k-means clustering and geospatial analysis to group restaurants based on their location and generate recommendations based on the user's proximity to those groups.
